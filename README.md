# Pentesting Mindmaps
I have created the following Mind Maps for penetration testing. This is part of my methodology. I begin with the Machine template and as I enumerate I am able to verify open ports. As each port and service are ewliminated I remove them from the template. Once all open port/services are identified exploitation candidates are determined.

As I run through exploitation notes and screenshots are attached to the appropriate area and the exploitation path is the only path left.

Finally, The outline is copied and used for the final report!
